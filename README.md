# Information
**NOTE:** I am by no means an expert SourcePawn scripter and appreciate any improvements that I can make.

This version of standard_allocator is a plug and play plugin, this means that there is (as of now) no configuration needed. I do plan on adding a configuration file to this plugin.

As of now it adds 5 pistol rounds at the beginning of the game, and the rest of the rounds will be rifle rounds.
Using the default !guns command will open up a menu where players can configure their weapons. Both round types have their own category and enables players to set their weapons for each side.
